This repository shows my own implemented examples  of the 5 <b>SOLID design principles</b> used in software engineering.

These 5 design principles are intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible  and maintainable.

The 5 SOLID design principles are the:

1. (S) <b>Single-responsibility principle</b>

2. (O) <b>Openâ€“closed principle</b>

3. (L) <b>Liskov substitution principle</b>

4. (I) <b>Interface segregation principle</b>

5. (D) <b>Dependency inversion principle</b>

For an overview of the 5 SOLID design principles:

I included basic php unit testing.
